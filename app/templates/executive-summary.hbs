  <p><span style="font-size:2em;">Spofford Design</span>, a purveyor and manufacturer of furniture and home goods, inhabits a world in which top-down design delivered through traditional mass market channels dominates. But it has begun to sputter. Millennials are the generation that has come of age in an era of complexity and interconnection. Established brands struggle to predict and adapt to their buying patterns. Spofford design will succeed because it understands millennials have ambitions beyond the purchase of a single piece of furniture, and remain with them through that journey. Spofford aligns the passions and interests with those of other consumers, designers, and a regional network of manufacturers.</p>

  <p>The significant year-over-year growth in millennial furniture purchase indicate that many millennials have started a similar journey. They likely have little experience with interior design, but can’t or won’t employ a design expert. Meanwhile, independent furniture designers have fought for years against large, established brands. They often fight side by side with small scale manufacturers in the regions where they work. While one actor’s final goals may differ from the goals of the other two, their fight is the same.</p>

  <p>Millennials have already changed industries, like food and beverages. But unlike food the risk associated with buying the right couch is much greater than that associated with a bad meal. And more similar to clothing, furniture not only addresses practical need, but makes a personal statement. Failure to execute well on creating a space could have grave consequences. Many buyers don’t design, but opt for neutral colors or established trends. Spofford Design appears in their lives to inspire them to think bigger.</p>

  <p>The journey begins for millennials when just moving in together or buying a house. There are functional needs to meet. But they desire a statement, and want to establish a personal aesthetic. Spofford’s brand inspires a practical home with character. We encourage a transformation from consumer to co-creator, supported by a network of other like actors.</p>

  <p>Consumers grow as they cultivate their spaces. Thanks in part to the mentorship they find through Spofford, consumers become more confident and less risk averse. Spofford acts as an older sister who’s been there already and has encouragement and practical advice. This extends not only the consumer, but to the designers and manufacturers, too. Spofford relies on the assistance and wisdom of other mentors eager to answer the question of how to ensure the satisfaction, confidence, and pride of everyone on their journey. Rather than a benign authority, we provide a platform for consumers, designers, and manufacturers who use the platform that Spofford provides to create value and delight. </p>

  <p>On the surface, Spofford will appear as an especially unique e-commerce furniture and home goods brand. The brand will encourage a reframing of the thinking about space, and will see that a deeper experience is possible. Victory arrives when the consumer emerges with a great space and greater confidence. We will invite them to co-create further as a part of the cooperative.</p>

  <p>Spofford design values co-creation, and the unique experience, innovative capacity, and dreams of every individual. We attract, not just promote. Brands and technology are at their best when they bring people together, not just complete a transaction. Spofford’s greatest success occurs when more people join the co-creative community to co-create together, each providing their unique contribution. Everyone has their journey, and buy acknowledging that Spofford will completely redefine the interior design experience and furniture manufacturing landscape.</p>
